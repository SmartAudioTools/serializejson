**serializejson**  is a python library for fast serialization and deserialization
of python objects in `JSON <http://json.org>`_  designed as a safe, interoperable and human-readable drop-in replacement for the Python `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ package.
Complex python object hierarchies are serializable, deserializable or updatable in once, allowing for example to save or restore a complete application state in few lines of code.
The library is build upon
`python-rapidjson <https://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson>`_,
`pybase64 <https://github.com/mayeut/pybase64>`_ and
`blosc <https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc>`_  for optional `zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd>`_ compression.

Some of the main features:

- supports Python 3.7 (maybe lower) or greater.
- serializes arbitrary python objects into a dictionary by adding `__class__` ,and eventually `__init__`, `__new__`, `__state__`, `__items__` keys.
- calls the same objects methods as pickle. Therefore almost all pickable objects are serializable with serializejson without any modification.
- for not already pickable object, you will allways be able to serialize it by adding methodes to the object or creating plugins for pickle or serializejson.
- generally 2x slower than pickle for dumping and 3x slower than pickle for loading (on your benchmark) except for big arrays (optimisation will soon be done).
- serializes and deserializes bytes and bytearray very quickly in base64 thanks to `pybase64 <https://github.com/mayeut/pybase64>`_ and lossless `blosc <https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc>`_ compression.
- serialize properties and attributes with getters and setters if wanted (unlike pickle).
- json data will still be directly loadable if you have transform some attributes in slots or properties in your code since your last serialization. (unlike pickle)
- can serialize `__init__(self,..)` arguments by name instead of positions, allowing to skip arguments with defauts values and making json datas robust to a change of `__init__` parameters order.
- serialized objects take generally less space than when serialized with pickle: for binary data, the 30% increase due to base64 encoding is in general largely compensated using the lossless `c-blosc2 <https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2>`_ compression (see the benchmarks below).
- serialized objects are human-readable and easy to read. Unlike pickled data, your data will never become unreadable if your code evolves: you will always be able to modify your datas with a text editor (with find & replace for example if you change an attribut name).
- serialized objects are text and therefore versionable and comparable with versionning and comparaison tools.
- can safely load untrusted / unauthenticated sources if authorized_classes list parameter is set carefully with strictly necessary objects (unlike pickle).
- can update existing objects recursively instead of override them. serializejson can be used to save and restore in place a complete application state (⚠ not yet well tested).
- filters attribute starting with "_" by default (unlike pickle). You can keep them if wanted with `filter_ = False`.
- numpy arrays can be serialized as lists with automatic conversion in both ways or in a conservative way.
- supports circular references and serialize only once duplicated objects, lists and dictionaries, using "$ref" key an path to the first occurance in the json : `{"$ref": "root.xxx.elt"}`.
- accepts json with comment (// and /\* \*/) if `accept_comments = True`.
- can automatically recognize objects in json from keys names and recreate them, without the need of `__class__` key, if passed in `recognized_classes`.
- serializejson is easly interoperable outside of the Python ecosystem with this recognition of objects from keys names or with `__class__` translation between python and other language classes.
- dump and load support string path.
- can iteratively encode (with append) and decode (with iterator) a list in json file, which helps saving memory space during the process of serialization and deserialization and useful for logs.

.. warning::

    **⚠** Do not load serializejson files from untrusted / unauthenticated sources without carefully setting the load authorized_classes parameter.

    **⚠** Never dump a dictionary with the `__class__` key, otherwise serializejson will attempt to reconstruct an object when loading the json.
    Be careful not to allow a user to manually enter a dictionary key somewhere without checking that it is not `__class__`.
    Due to current limitation of rapidjson we cannot we cannot at the moment efficiently detect dictionaries with the `__class__` key to raise an error.


Benchmarks against pickle
=========================

All charts below compare serializejson **with its default settings** (the
"smart" compression chain: blocked derivative → zigzag → bitshuffle → zstd
level 1, base64 and JSON envelope **included**) against ``pickle.dumps``
protocol 4, on deterministic synthetic profiles (audio, sorted timestamps,
smooth signals and surfaces, incompressible noise as the honest worst case).
Every value is a ratio pickle / serializejson: **above ×1, the advantage goes
to serializejson**. They are produced by ``python tests/lance_benchmarks.py``
(median of ~50 trials, alternated in the same process).

Pure in-memory conversion — serialized size is typically **2 to 20× smaller**
(geometric mean: 40 % of pickle's size), while pickle, which is a simple
memory copy (~20 GB/s from cache), stays faster on CPU time alone:

As soon as the bytes have to reach a storage device or a network, the saved
bytes also save time: the curves below show the **total** time ratio
(serialization + transfer at the given throughput). On a hard drive or a
SATA SSD, serializejson is faster than pickle on almost every profile — on
fast NVMe drives, pickle stays ahead for barely-compressible data:
